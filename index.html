    <h3>This bot stores the username and ID of users who submit a story prompt or story entry, as well as the prompt or entry submitted. It also stores the ID of each guild it's in, as well as the discord channel ID a user sets the bot to use. This data is stored via Google's Firebase Database.</h3>
    <h3>Members of a Discord server you submit prompts/passages in may view the contributions you've made to a story, and see it as attributed to your username.</h3>
